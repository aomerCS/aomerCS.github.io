    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Cloud Chaser</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, classes & objects, randomness and methods. 
	I created a player object that displays a square, and platform objects that 
	starts at a random x position but always the same y position and bounces off 
	the horizontal walls. The player class stores values for acceleration,
	velocity, friction and such to allow accurate physics for the player.
	

	Platformer game where you control a square climbing up hoping to go beyond the stars!
	The game tracks your level and time taken, reach the top of the sketch to enter the next level.
	TIP: As a square, he doesnt have much friction so take into account some sliding when moving left and right.
	Open the game with the file name Cloud_Chaser to ensure the game opens with all the files attached!

	CONTROLS: 
	W - Jump
	A - Left
	D - Right
